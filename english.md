# Tell me about an extremely cold winter or any other period of extreme weather that you've experienced.
It is a funny topic, because I live in a country where we have extremely cold winters quite often. It is hard to manage the situation of streets in the city when we have winter. Fortunately we have a special group of road services to support us in that hard situation. But every year when snow starts falling the first day is extremely hard. For everyone and this road service, it is a shock that so much snow has fallen down and all cities stop in traffic jams. One year I remember that there was so much snow that all the city stopped. People left their cars and went home on foot. They had to went on the foot because stopped also all public transport. What is more, it was the first day of winter. In my country we have a very popular quote “As every year, again winter surprised our road services “. But people understand that it is hard for road services when they are surprised and they have to have  a little time to start to manage our public roads in the city. It's a little like your first day in a new job. You don’t know what to expect :)

# In your opinion, how can developing countries reduce debt?
Fiscal and monetary policy are areas where decisions are very important for countries. In my opinion, developing countries have many options to reduce debt. Many times we heard that the solution to reduce debt is to increase tax but it isn't a good idea.  I’m not a specialist but developing countries  should invest more  in new technologie, specialist workers and knowledge. By knowledge I mean support universities and convince young people to study. Also good options are supporting entrepreneurs and trying to build a competitive industry and business. What is more, politicians should consider supporting society's budget and convince people to spend money so that the economy accelerates. All described proposals should strengthen trade and increase cash flow from the taxes. As I mentioned, I am not a specialist, but I think that the more cash from taxes flows into the state budget, the less money is needed form the loan.

# Name one commodity you would consider investing in. And please tell me why!
If I was a risk taker I would have invested in renewable energy sources because all populations don’t have other options,  they have to change their approach to the environment. I try to be a green eco man and the environment is important for me. Fortunately a lot of governments want to change politics and produce energy without fossil fuel but in my opinion it is too slow. World has a lot of options like solar radiation, water, wind, energy from solid and liquid biomass, geothermal energy, and tidal and ocean currents to produce energy. Maybe it will be a good idea to invest in green companies. I can't imagine that we will not use this chance and we will leave fossil fuel. If not, in the future we will have to find a new planet to live and maybe it will be a good option to invest in a company like Spacex.

# In the dialogue, one of the speakers describes why impressionist paintings are good for offices. Why do you agree or disagree with her?
It is hard to say. In my opinion impressionist painters are not good for the office. Impressionist paintings showing nature, people and they are full of beautiful color. That is too distracting. Nowadays offices are modern and should have modern paintings because this type of art is very interesting and draws attention. It is important because displaying art in the workplace can elevate employee performance, mood, and physical well-being, as well as bolster interpersonal bonds between employees and clients. Well-considered art decisions for the workplace give workers convenience and attractiveness. What is more, our brains hold onto memorable environmental features, art can usefully function as a landmark, helping people traveling through a space to remember where they have been. In summary, art is a good idea for our office, but we must carefully choose the type of art.

Mountains in Poland are, next to the Baltic Sea and lakes, one of the biggest attractions for tourists who value contact with nature. Mountains in Poland include 3 main mountain ranges: Sudetes , Carpathians and Świętokrzyskie Mountains and 28 smaller mountain ranges within them. The highest and the youngest are the Carpathians with the Tatra Mountains, and the oldest and lowest are the Świętokrzyskie Mountains. Those who like mountain hiking can choose among various trails in Poland, including trails suitable for families with children, seniors, and all those who love nature.

The highest peak in Polish Tatras Rysy is 2,499 m but the mountains are rich in trails suitable for families with children, seniors, and all those who love nature.

# When you go shopping, do you prefer to be outdoors in the city center or in a shopping mall? Why?
To answer this question, I have to answer it depending on the situation :) The city center is close to my mind, because I don’t like crowds and close spaces. I feel more comfortable in the fresh air and the best options are various kinds of fairs. But my wife and daughters love shopping malls and sometimes I have to spend time in shopping malls. It is a pleasure for me when I go there to buy something for myself. But when I don’t have plans to buy something for myself it is boring and very often I am nervous and I don’t know wny? Probably it is a waste of time for me but I want to be a good husband and father and I try not to complain when I am in a shopping mall with my family. Fortunately technologies help me and ofen I try to find some place to sit in front of the shop, live ther my girls and surf the internet on my phone.  Thank God for iphone and 5G :)
